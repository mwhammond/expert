    <h2>Advisors are critical to start-up success</h2>
    <br>
    <p>At <a href="http://www.imperialinnovations.co.uk">Imperial Innovations</a> we invest in early stage, high growth start-ups. We regularly meet <b>amazing teams</b> that unfortunately lack the right connections to fully understand the drivers, structure and incentives of their desired market vertical. We also meet a large number of <b>senior industry professionals</b> who are keen to work with start-ups to add value and enable disruption within their industries.

      <h3>The current solution limits high potential start-ups</h3>  

      <p>Unfortunately finding each other can take many months of random networking events, often significant cost and is highly dependent on the local maxima of individual networks. We thought that there must be a better way.</p>

      <h3>A new fast, effective approach</h3>

      <p>Our vision to enable online, direct connections between key industry figures who understand innovation and the high quality start-ups that are best placed to implement disruptive solutions. If you would like to learn more we are currently in beta but accepting pre-registrations; <%= link_to "register your startup", home_startupsignup_path %> or <%= link_to "apply to be an advisor", home_startupsignup_path %>. </p>
